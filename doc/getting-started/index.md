# Getting Started

This article will be an introduction to the MobSin game engine showcasing certain features and building a small from scratch.

After completing this walkthrough you are encouraged to read [the full documentation](../documentation/classes) to get an in-depth understanding of what each feature of the engine does and how to use it.

## Installation and Setup

The first thing we need is the engine itself. Follow the four simple steps in the [installation guide](../documentation/install) to build the JavaScript file from the source code, then open `examples/Simple Setup/index.html` file in your browser and the `script.js` in a text editor of your choice.

If you have done everything correctly you should see an empty black screen with a white box - that is the canvas we will be drawing to.
