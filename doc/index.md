## Overview

**MobSin** is a powerful, lightweight and extensible 2D game engine written in Javascript using the latest ES6 syntax.

It aims to provide you with the tools necessary to quickly and efficiently create games for the browser.

## Getting Started

You can put something on the screen in under twenty lines of code and from there *the world is your oyster*.

Visit the [Getting Started](getting-started) section for a simple and easy setup guide that introduces you to creating a basic game.

You can also follow along with the documentation, as it will naturally take you through how the engine works, providing comprehensive explanations for each element of the engine coupled with useful examples.

## Documentation

Full documentation concerning development with the **MobSin** game engine is in the [Documentation](documentation/classes.md) section.

It will give you extensive information in learning concepts within the engine, information on all game classes, installation and importation of the engine, as well as plenty of examples to go with documentation to help your understanding.

## Install

**MobSin** takes advantage of [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) to compile its source code down into a single, usable Javascript file.

See the [Installation section](documentation/install.md) for instructions on compiling from source.
